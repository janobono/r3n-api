# r3n-api

simple way to write SQL query in java

## foreword

It was sometime in the summer of 2012 when I met a somebody who wanted to create a program his nickname was r3ner. I
didn't know where to start but because I am Java Developer, I programmed it all in Java. Set o libraries used with this
program was designed. Originally also contained Swing components
([tag 1.0.0](https://github.com/janobono/r3n-api/tree/1.0.0/r3n/r3n-ui)), over time, it transformed into the form in
which it is currently. Some things are historical, but I don't want to delete them. Use freely.
